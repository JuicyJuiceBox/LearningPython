# LearningPython
Collection of code from my Python learning journey

Welcome to my FIRST ReadMe!

If you're reading this, then you're either lost, or here to look over my n00b code.
Either way, thanks for stopping by!

This repository is where I will be storing select Python projects I've put together for learning purposes.
Expect to see some solutions to Code Wars katas and ideas I've crashed my way through with some degree of success.

Any submissions which show a more effective, or efficient way of doing any of the tasks my code is trying to accomplish are appreciated.
Please keep in mind that I had no programming experience before learning Python and I started my journey in January of 2022

Enjoy your constructive ridcule!
